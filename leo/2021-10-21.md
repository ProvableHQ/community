Welcome to the notes page for the most recent Leo standup. Please see below for topics covered during the public discussion:

## Agenda

* Weekly standups from the Leo team (30 min.)
* Current sprint epic conversation (10 min.)
* Community questions (15 min.)

## Standups

### Jon

Updates:

* Bits/Bytes PR finishing touches. It's under review in snarkvm at the moment.
  * It implements to bits and bytes for all types.
  * Does not implement from bits and bytes for chars, fields and groups. Those will be done in a future PR.
* Pairing work with Ed on Casting.
  * ASG constants casting now inline with the IR.
  * Updated to only work for casting from ints and to ints with some type checking.
  * I.e. they return an Error if you try to cast a int that won't fit into a smaller int.
  * SnarkVM side going well, would like to wait bits/bytes to land first to make some of those changes easier.
* Investigating IR constraint changes with Elijah.
* RFC re-write for bits and bytes.
  * Discussion on going there.
* Other feature and bug discussions.
* Have a PR with:
  * .len() function changed to a new access expression and core function mapping.
  * That allows the CoreFunction annotations only in internal stdlib files.

Blockers:

* None

### Damir

Updates:

* fixed flying duplicates bug - no longer an issue
* working on const functions
    * global const functions done
    * rewriting circuit member parsing to allow const functions there
    * adding tests for each possible scenario
* then will work on adding it to the IR

Blockers:

* None

### Eric M

Updates:

* None

* None

### Max

Updates:

* None

Blockers:

* None

### Alessandro

Updates:

* Created new document on multi-transition transaction model (in Google Doc).
* Looked at test discrepancies between Leo compiler's parser and ACL2 parser of Leo (with Eric M.):
  * Found and fixed two bugs in ABNF grammar.
  * Found some differences between ABNF gramar and Leo compiler's parser.

Blockers:

* None

### Elijah

Updates:

* staging branch!
    * leo now has a staging branch that points at SnarkVM/master instead of release
    * this will allow us to work with the newest snarkvm features as they get merged instead of having to wait for/rush releases of snarkvm just for leo
    * please branch from leo/staging and point all your PR's at leo/staging 
    * make sure your cargo file's now points at SnarkVM/master
    * master and staging now require 3 reviewers to merge
* Did some investigating into IR constraint changes with john
    * there was originally some confusion over the usage of constraint systems but collin luckily cleared that up
    * state file is now actually evaluated so it generates constraints even if the values arent used
    * output registers generate one constraint for each bit being returned. not sure where we landed on that with collin
* fixed a small bug in bounded recursion. the branch is still waiting for review in SnarkVM
* working on moving the synthesizer over to snarkvm so we can stop relying on TestConstraintSystem for snarkvm tests
    * should also simplify a lot of the namespace annoyances within snarkvm

Blockers:

* None

### Mazdak

Updates:

* None.

Blockers:

* None.

### Ed

Updates:

* Began implementing the casting functionality pairing with Jon.
  * Handling the overflow behavior requires changing the return type of
    `const_value` to return a `Result` to handle the errors.
  * Rewriting methods as-needed to adapt to the new return type.

Blockers:

* None.

### Topics

* None.
